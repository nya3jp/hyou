.. py:currentmodule:: hyou


Synopsis
--------

.. code:: python

    import hyou

    # Login to Google Spreadsheet with credentials
    collection = hyou.login('/path/to/credentails.json')

    # Open a spreadsheet by ID
    spreadsheet = collection['1ZYeIFccacgHkL0TPfdgXiMfPCuEEWUtbhXvaB9HBDzQ']
    print(repr(spreadsheet.title))        # => "Hyou Test Sheet"

    # Open a worksheet in a spreadsheet by sheet name
    worksheet = spreadsheet['Sheet1']
    print(repr(worksheet.title))          # => "Sheet1"
    print(repr(worksheet.rows))           # => 5
    print(repr(worksheet.cols))           # => 3

    # Create a view to access worksheet data
    view = worksheet.view()

    # A view is a two-dimensional list of cell objects that can be
    # accessed intuitively.
    print(repr(view[1][0].formatted_value))         # => "banana"
    print(repr(view[1][1].formatted_value))         # => "50"
    print(repr(view[1][1].effective_value))         # => 50

    # Writing data to cells is also straightforward.
    view[2][0].user_entered_value = 'cinamon'
    view[2][1].user_entered_value = 40
    view[2][1].user_entered_format.background_color = (1, 1, 0)  # yellow
    view.commit()


User Guide
----------


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hyou can be installed from pypi with pip.

.. code::

    $ sudo pip install hyou
    or
    $ pip install --user hyou

Source code is available on GitHub.

https://github.com/google/hyou


Preparing Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is to prepare a credential you access Google Spreadsheet with.

There are three options:

1. Authorize as your Google account with OAuth2 using a shared application project.
2. Authorize as your Google account with OAuth2 using your own application project.
3. Authorize as a service account (a bot account not associated with any Google account).

If you just want to access your spreadsheet programatically, 1 is the safe and easy way. In other options, you need some steps to register an application at Google Developer Console. (TODO(nya): Describe those options too)

To authorize as your Google account with a shared application project, run ``generate_oauth2_credentials.py``.

.. code::

    $ generate_oauth2_credentials.py ~/.drive.json
    Please visit this URL to get the authorization code:
    https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?scope=...

    Code:_

Open the URL with a web browser, click "Accept" button, copy-and-paste the authorization code to the console and hit enter. Then the credential JSON is saved to the specified file.

Keep the credential file in a safe location. With the credentials, all your Google Drive documents can be accessed.

Once you prepared a credential JSON file, it is very simple to connect to Google Spreadsheet service using it:

.. code:: python

    collection = hyou.login('/path/to/credentails.json')


Working with Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :py:class:`Collection` object represents a set of Google Spreadsheet documents. It is a dictionary-like object, whose key is spreadsheet ID and value is a :py:class:`Spreadsheet` object.

You can enumerate the spreadsheets you own by accessing a :py:class:`Collection` object like a dictionary.

.. code:: python

    for id, spreadsheet in collection.iteritems():
        print(id, spreadsheet.title)

If you know a spreadsheet ID, you can open it just by indexing. This is faster than iterating through :py:class:`Collection` because it does not fetch the list of spreadsheets. For example, to open https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZYeIFccacgHkL0TPfdgXiMfPCuEEWUtbhXvaB9HBDzQ/edit :

.. code:: python

    spreadsheet = collection['1ZYeIFccacgHkL0TPfdgXiMfPCuEEWUtbhXvaB9HBDzQ']


Working with Spreadsheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :py:class:`Spreadsheet` object is an ordered dictionary-like object, whose key is a worksheet title and value is a :py:class:`Worksheet` object.

.. code:: python

    worksheet = spreadsheet['Sheet1']

It also behaves just like a list when accessed with integer indices since it is ordered.

.. code:: python

    worksheet = spreadsheet[0]  # Open the first worksheet

To add or delete worksheets, use :py:meth:`Spreadsheet.add_worksheet` and :py:meth:`Spreadsheet.delete_worksheet`.

.. code:: python

    new_worksheet = spreadsheet.add_worksheet('worksheet title', rows=1000, cols=26)
    spreadsheet.delete_worksheet('worksheet title')

:py:attr:`Spreadsheet.title` read-write property holds the title of the spreadsheet.

.. code:: python

    print(spreadsheet.title)  # => Current spreadsheet name
    spreadsheet.title = 'New spreadsheet name'


Working with Worksheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :py:class:`Worksheet` object represents a sheet in a spreadsheet.

It provides several attributes:

.. code:: python

    print(worksheet.title)        # => Sheet1
    print(worksheet.rows)         # => 1000
    print(worksheet.cols)         # => 26
    print(worksheet.frozen_rows)  # => 2
    print(worksheet.frozen_cols)  # => 1

Those attributes are writable.

.. code:: python

    worksheet.title = "New Sheet Name"
    worksheet.rows = 1024
    worksheet.cols = 40
    worksheet.set_size(1024, 40)  # Sets rows/cols at once
    worksheet.frozen_rows = 3
    worksheet.frozen_cols = 2
    worksheet.set_frozen_size(3, 2)  # Sets rows/cols at once

The most important method is :py:meth:`Worksheet.view` which returns a view of a worksheet.

.. code:: python

    # View of whole the sheet
    view = worksheet.view()

    # View of a limited range
    view = worksheet.view(start_row=1, end_row=1000, start_col=10, end_col=13)


Working with Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :py:class:`View` object can be accessed just like a two-dimensional list of :py:class:`Cell` objects.

.. code:: python

    cell = view[0][0]
    print(repr(cell.user_input_value))  # => 283
    print(repr(cell.effective_value))   # => 283
    print(repr(cell.formatted_value))   # => "283"

    for i, row in enumerate(view):
        print(i,
              row[0].formatted_value,
              '/'.join(cell.formatted_value for cell in row[1:]))

A cell value is a bare input string, represented as a unicode string (:py:class:`str` in Python 3, :py:class:`unicode` in Python 2).

- Numbers are converted to strings.
- Formulas (e.g. `"=SUM(A2:A)"`) are never expanded, and returned as-is.

Inversely, you can create a formula cell by writing a formula string like `"=SUM(A2:A)"`.

If you attempt to write a non-string value (e.g. numbers) to a cell, it is automatically converted to a string.

.. code:: python

    worksheet[0][0] = 7
    print(type(worksheet[0][0]))  # => str in Python 3, unicode in Python 2

Writes to cells are never committed until :py:meth:`Worksheet.commit` is called. You can use *with statements* to make sure :py:meth:`Worksheet.commit` is called:

.. code:: python

    with worksheet:
        worksheet[0][0] = 'apple'
        worksheet[1][0] = 'banana'
        worksheet[2][0] = 'cinamon'
    # Changes have been committed at this point


.. _cache-behavior-section:

Cache Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To reduce network traffic and round-trips, data is fetched on demand and cached. For example, calling :py:meth:`Worksheet.values()` first time takes some time to fetch data to servers, but subsequent calls return immediately because the server response is cached.

To clear the cache to access the up-to-date data, call :py:func:`refresh`.

Please be aware that any uncommitted writes to worksheet cells are discarded when :py:func:`refresh` is called.

As for :py:class:`Worksheet`, all worksheet cells are fetched when a cell is attempted to read for the first time. This can be waste of time and bandwidth if you are interested in a subrange of a worksheet. In such case, you can use views described next.


API Reference
-------------

.. data:: SCOPES

   A tuple of strings representing the scopes needed to access spreadsheets.
   Use this constant to request OAuth2 credentials.


.. function:: login(json_path=None, json_text=None)

   Logs in to Google Spreadsheet, and returns a new :py:class:`Collection` object.

   :param str json_path: The filesystem path to a credential JSON file.
   :param str json_text: A credential JSON in text format.

   Either one of `json_path` or `json_text` should be given.

   This method accepts two formats of credential JSONs:

   1. JSON file that serialized :py:class:`oauth2client.client.Credentials`.
   2. JSON file downloaded from Google Developer Console (for service accounts)


.. class:: Collection

   Representation of your spreadsheet collection.

   This is a dictionary-like object, implementing several dictionary methods like
   :py:meth:`keys`, :py:meth:`values`, :py:meth:`items`,
   :py:meth:`iterkeys`, :py:meth:`itervalues`, :py:meth:`iteritems`,
   :py:meth:`__len__`, :py:meth:`__iter__`.
   In contrast to usual :py:class:`dict`, it is immutable (unless :py:meth:`refresh` is called).

   .. classmethod:: login(json_path=None, json_text=None)

      An alias of :py:func:`login`.

   .. method:: create_spreadsheet(title, rows=1000, cols=26)

      Creates a new spreadsheet, and returns a :py:class:`Spreadsheet` instance.

      :param str title: The title of a new spreadsheet.
      :param int rows: The number of rows of a new spreadsheet.
      :param int cols: The number of cols of a new spreadsheet.

      Addition of a spreadsheet is committed immediately and :py:meth:`refresh` is automatically called to reflect changes.

   .. method:: refresh()

      Discards the associated cache. See :ref:`cache-behavior-section` for details.


.. class:: Spreadsheet

   Representation of a spreadsheet.

   This is a dictionary-like object, implementing several dictionary methods like
   :py:meth:`keys`, :py:meth:`values`, :py:meth:`items`,
   :py:meth:`iterkeys`, :py:meth:`itervalues`, :py:meth:`iteritems`,
   :py:meth:`__len__`, :py:meth:`__iter__`.
   In contrast to usual :py:class:`dict`, it is immutable (unless :py:meth:`refresh` is called), and elements are ordered.

   Ordered values can by accessed by indices. That is, ``obj[i]`` is equivalent to ``obj.values()[i]`` when ``i`` is an integer.

   .. attribute:: key

      The spreadsheet ID.

      This property is read-only.

   .. attribute:: title

      The title of the spreadsheet.

      This property is writable. Writes are committed immediately and :py:meth:`refresh` is automatically called to reflect changes.

   .. attribute:: url

      The URL of the spreadsheet.

      This property is read-only.

   .. attribute:: updated

      The last update time of the spreadsheet as a :py:class:`datetime.datetime` object.

      This property is read-only.

   .. method:: add_worksheet(title, rows=100, cols=26)

      Deletion of a worksheet is committed immediately and :py:meth:`refresh` is automatically called to reflect changes.

   .. method:: refresh()

      Discards the associated cache. See :ref:`cache-behavior-section` for details.


.. class:: Worksheet

   Representation of a worksheet.

   This object behaves just like two-dimensional string lists. The first dimension is rows and the second is columns.

   .. attribute:: title

      The title of the worksheet.

      This property is writable. Writes are committed immediately and :py:meth:`refresh` is automatically called to reflect changes.

   .. attribute:: rows

      The number of rows of the worksheet.

      Use :py:meth:`set_size` to change the number of both rows and columns simultaneously.

   .. attribute:: cols

      The number of columns of the worksheet.

      This property is writable. Writes are committed immediately and :py:meth:`refresh` is automatically called to reflect changes.

      Use :py:meth:`set_size` to change the number of both rows and columns simultaneously.

   .. method:: commit()

      Commits writes to cells. Until this method is called, writes to cells never take effect.

   .. method:: set_size(rows, cols)

      Changes the dimension of the worksheet.

      :param int rows: The new number of rows.
      :param int cols: The new number of cols.

      Changes are committed immediately and :py:meth:`refresh` is automatically called to reflect changes.

   .. method:: view(start_row=None, end_row=None, start_col=None, end_col=None)

      Creates a new :py:class:`WorksheetView` representing a subrange of the worksheet.

      :param integer start_row: The index of the first row included in a new view. Defaults to 0 if not specified.
      :param integer end_row: The index of the first row NOT included in a new view. Default to :py:attr:`rows` if not specified.
      :param integer start_col: The index of the first column included in a new view. Defaults to 0 if not specified.
      :param integer end_col: The index of the first column NOT included in a new view. Default to :py:attr:`cols` if not specified.

   .. attribute:: cols

      The number of columns in this view. Read-only.

   .. method:: commit()

      Commits writes to cells. Until this method is called, writes to cells never take effect.

   .. method:: __enter__
   .. method:: __exit__

      These methods implements context manager protocol to make sure :py:meth:`commit` is called.

   .. method:: refresh()

      Discards the associated cache. Please be aware that any uncommitted writes to cells are also discarded. See :ref:`cache-behavior-section` for details.
